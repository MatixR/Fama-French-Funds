An exercise similar to Fama, French (2010). Goal is to identify and evaluate the luck vs skill of active managers.

Original idea was to replicate a Fama, French (2010) finding for given dataset. The base structure of the code is borrowed
from a master's thesis by Kyjell Jorgensen and rewritten from Matlab into Python.
